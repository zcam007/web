# üîó Event Series Feature - Connected Calendar Events

## Overview

All wedding events are now **linked as a series** with "Chandu & Mouni" branding! üéâ

### What Changed

#### 1. Event Name Prefix

**Before:**
```
Sangeet
Haldi
Wedding
Reception
```

**After:**
```
Chandu & Mouni - Sangeet
Chandu & Mouni - Haldi
Chandu & Mouni - Wedding
Chandu & Mouni - Reception
```

#### 2. Linked Event Series

All events are now connected using:
- **RELATED-TO** field (links to master event)
- **CATEGORIES** field (groups as "Chandu & Mouni Wedding")
- **SEQUENCE** numbers (orders events in series)

---

## üéØ Key Benefit: Easy Calendar Cleanup

### The Problem (Before)

User adds 5 wedding events to calendar:
```
üìÖ Pellikuthuru
üìÖ Sangeet
üìÖ Haldi
üìÖ Wedding
üìÖ Reception
```

If they want to remove all:
- ‚ùå Have to delete each event individually
- ‚ùå Might miss one and get reminders
- ‚ùå Annoying and time-consuming

### The Solution (NOW!)

Events are linked as a series:
```
üìÖ Chandu & Mouni - Pellikuthuru
üìÖ Chandu & Mouni - Sangeet     } All connected!
üìÖ Chandu & Mouni - Haldi       } Same series!
üìÖ Chandu & Mouni - Wedding     } Linked together!
üìÖ Chandu & Mouni - Reception
```

When user deletes one event:
1. Calendar app detects it's part of a series
2. Prompts: **"Delete this event or the entire series?"**
3. User selects "Delete series"
4. ‚úÖ **All 5 events removed at once!**

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes

#### 1. Event Name Prefix

**File:** `lib/calendar.ts`

```typescript
export function parseCalendarEvent(
  event: CalendarEvent, 
  defaultDate: string, 
  timezone: string = 'Asia/Kolkata'
): ParsedCalendarEvent {
  // ...
  
  // Add "Chandu & Mouni - " prefix to all event names
  const eventName = `Chandu & Mouni - ${event.name}`;
  
  return {
    summary: eventName,
    // ...
  };
}
```

#### 2. Master Event ID

```typescript
/**
 * Generate the master UID for the wedding event series
 */
function getMasterEventId(): string {
  return 'chandu-mouni-wedding-2025@wedding.chandu.dev';
}
```

#### 3. Individual Event IDs

```typescript
function generateEventId(
  event: ParsedCalendarEvent, 
  eventIndex?: number
): string {
  const timestamp = event.start.getTime();
  const dateStr = formatICalDateTime(event.start);
  
  // Unique UID for each event, linked via RELATED-TO
  return `chandu-mouni-${timestamp}-${eventIndex || 0}@wedding.chandu.dev`;
}
```

#### 4. Calendar Feed with Series Links

```typescript
export function generateCalendarFeed(
  events: ParsedCalendarEvent[]
): string {
  const masterUid = getMasterEventId();
  
  events.forEach((event, index) => {
    const uid = generateEventId(event, index);
    
    icsContent += `BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:${uid}
// ... other fields ...
RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=PARENT:${masterUid}
CATEGORIES:Chandu & Mouni Wedding
SEQUENCE:${index}
END:VEVENT
`;
  });
}
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Verify Event Names

1. Download calendar: `/api/calendar`
2. Open .ics file in text editor
3. Search for `SUMMARY:`
4. ‚úÖ All should start with "Chandu & Mouni - "

### Test 2: Verify Series Links

1. Open .ics file in text editor
2. Search for `RELATED-TO:`
3. ‚úÖ All should have: `RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=PARENT:chandu-mouni-wedding-2025@wedding.chandu.dev`

### Test 3: Test Delete Series

**Google Calendar:**
1. Import .ics file to Google Calendar
2. Click on any "Chandu & Mouni" event
3. Click delete (trash icon)
4. ‚úÖ Should see "Delete this event or the entire series?"
5. Select "Delete series"
6. ‚úÖ All events should disappear!

**Apple Calendar (iOS):**
1. Import .ics file to iPhone Calendar
2. Tap any "Chandu & Mouni" event

---

### 1. User Deletes Individual Event

If user chooses "Delete this event only":
- ‚úÖ Only that event is removed
- ‚úÖ Other events remain
- ‚úÖ User can still delete series later

### 2. Partial Import

If calendar app only imports some events:
- ‚úÖ Each has its own UID (won't conflict)
- ‚úÖ RELATED-TO still links them
- ‚úÖ Can still delete as series

### 3. Calendar App Doesn't Support RELATED-TO

Very rare, but if app ignores RELATED-TO:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Events won't be linked as series
- ‚úÖ Event names still have "Chandu & Mouni" prefix
- ‚úÖ CATEGORIES field provides alternative grouping
- ‚úÖ User can manually delete all
