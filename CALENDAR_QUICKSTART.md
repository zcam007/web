# 🚀 Calendar Feature Quick Start

## What Was Added

Your wedding website now has a **fully functional calendar integration** that:

✅ **Automatically detects mobile devices** (iOS & Android)  
✅ **Shows a beautiful prompt** asking users to add events to their calendar  
✅ **Supports calendar subscription** (desktop users get auto-updates!)  
✅ **WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliant** for accessibility  
✅ **Zero configuration needed** - works out of the box!

---

## How It Works

### On Mobile (iOS/Android)

1. User opens your website on their phone
2. After 2 seconds, a beautiful modal appears asking if they want to add events
3. User taps "Add Events"
4. All wedding events download as a `.ics` file
5. Calendar app opens automatically with all events ready to add

### On Desktop

- Users can subscribe to the calendar feed
- Events auto-update when you change them in the config
- Uses `webcal://` protocol for seamless integration

## Files Created

```
app/(site)/
├── lib/
│   ├── calendar.ts              # Calendar generation logic
│   └── device-detection.ts      # Mobile device detection
├── api/
│   └── calendar/
│       └── route.ts             # API endpoint for .ics feed
└── components/
    ├── AddToCalendar.tsx        # Auto-prompt modal + floating button
    └── CalendarButton.tsx       # Reusable button component
```

**Modified Files:**
- `app/(site)/page.tsx` - Added `<AddToCalendar />` component
- `app/(site)/sections/Events.tsx` - Added calendar button to Events section
- `app/(site)/globals.css` - Added animation styles

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Mobile Test (iOS)

1. Deploy or run dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open website on iPhone using Safari
3. Wait 2 seconds - modal should appear
4. Tap "Add Events"
5. Calendar app should open with all events

### Quick Mobile Test (Android)

1. Open website on Android device
2. Wait 2 seconds - modal should appear
3. Tap "Add Events"
4. Google Calendar should open with events

### Desktop Test

1. Open website on desktop
2. No mobile prompt appears (correct!)
3. Check browser console: `window.location.href = '/api/calendar'`
4. Should download `wedding-events.ics` file

---

## API Endpoint

**URL:** `/api/calendar`

**What it does:**
- Reads events from `data/site.json`
- Generates iCalendar (.ics) format
- Maps event names to dates automatically:
  - Nov 24: Pellikuthuru, Mehendi
  - Nov 25: Sangeet, Haldi
  - Nov 26: Wedding/Muhurtham
  - Nov 30: Reception

**Try it:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3006/api/calendar
```

---

## How to Update Events

### Change Event Details

1. Edit `data/site.json`
2. Update event name, time, place, or description
3. Save the file
4. Done! ✨

**Desktop users**: Calendar auto-updates (may take hours depending on app)  
**Mobile users**: Must re-download .ics to see changes

### Change Event Dates

If you need to change the date mapping:

**Edit:** `app/(site)/lib/calendar.ts`

**Find function:** `getEventDate()`

**Example:**
```typescript
export function getEventDate(eventName: string): string {
  const name = eventName.toLowerCase();
  
  // Change this:
  if (name.includes('sangeet')) {
    return '2025-11-25'; // Your new date here
  }
  
  // ... rest of code
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Calendar button not showing

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
localStorage.clear();
// Then refresh the page
```

### Events have wrong dates

**Check:** Event names in `data/site.json`  
**Verify:** Date mapping in `lib/calendar.ts` → `getEventDate()`

### Calendar app not opening on mobile

**Try:**
1. Use different browser (Chrome/Safari)
2. Check browser allows .ics downloads
3. Manually tap the downloaded file

### Updates not showing

**Desktop:** Wait 1-24 hours for calendar app refresh  
**Mobile:** Delete old events and re-download .ics file

- **API Response:** ~2KB for all events
